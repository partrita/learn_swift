# Swift for Python Developers

Welcome to this Swift learning resource tailored for Python developers!

This guide aims to help you transition your Python knowledge to Swift, highlighting similarities and differences between the two languages.

## Structure

The materials are organized as follows:

- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the learning materials.
- **`learning_guide.md`**: The main document explaining Swift concepts with comparisons to Python.
- **`examples/`**: Contains Swift code examples demonstrating various concepts. Each example file is named descriptively (e.g., `variables_and_constants.swift`, `functions.swift`).
- **`exercises/`**: Contains exercises to practice Swift programming.
    - Each exercise will have its own Swift file (e.g., `exercise_1.swift`).
    - **`exercises/solutions/`**: Contains the solutions to the exercises (e.g., `solution_1.swift`).

## Getting Started

1.  Read through the `learning_guide.md` to understand the core concepts of Swift.
2.  Explore the code examples in the `examples/` directory to see Swift in action.
3.  Work through the exercises in the `exercises/` directory to solidify your understanding.
4.  Check your solutions against those provided in `exercises/solutions/`.

Happy learning!
